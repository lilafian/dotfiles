Full installation guide

1. Install Arch Linux
	Follow the official Arch Linux installation guide and install GRUB as the bootloader.
	Make sure to add neovim, sudo, and dhcpcd in the pacstrap command.
	Get to a point where you can log in as root

2. Start dhcpcd
	We need a DHCP client to connect to the internet to install packages. Run the following command to enable and start dhcpcd.
		systemctl enable --now dhcpcd
	If you need WiFi, also use the iwctl utility to connect.

3. Create user
	Run the following command, substituting <USERNAME> with your desired username
		useradd -m -G wheel -s /bin/zsh <USERNAME>
	Then, give the user a password by running
		passwd <USERNAME>

4. Install Z Shell
	Run the following command to install Z Shell so that we can log in as the correct user
		pacman -S zsh

5. Correct sudo configuration file
	Edit /etc/sudoers with neovim and uncomment the following line:
		%wheel ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL
	Additionally, I prefer to add the following line to show asterisks in place of password characters
		Defaults pwfeedback
	This line can go anywhere in the file.

6. Log in as a standard user
	Exit your root session, then log in with the username and password you created in step 3.

7. Install Oh My Zsh
	Run the following commands:
		pacman -S --needed git base-devel
		sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"

8. (NVIDIA ONLY) Install and fix NVIDIA drivers
	NVIDIA does not work out of the box with Wayland, and therefore Hyprland. We must install and fix the NVIDIA drivers.
	Follow the official Hyprland NVIDIA guide at:
		wiki.hypr.land/Nvidia
	And then go to step 9.

9. Run the install script
	Now, you can run the install script and let it do the work for you!

10. (If you installed it, configure Zen
    To get the best browser experience, I recommend adding two Zen mods, accessible from:
        about:preferences#zenMarketplace
    First, add Custom uiFont, and set:
        Select Font -> Custom
        font-family: ZedMono Nerd Font
        text-shadow: none
    Then, add Transparent Zen, and set:
        Allow transparency -> False
        Allow transparency on linux -> False
        Enable custom background color for Zen -> True
        Set custom background color -> #151515
    Then, customize all other settings to your liking (especially in Privacy and Security!)
